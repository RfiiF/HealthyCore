# HealthyCore

HealthyCore is a comprehensive digital health program covering pregnancy & parenting, fitness, and mental health. Here, you can calculate your RHR (resting heart rate), BMI, and calorie needs. Not only that, but there are also features to check stress levels, anxiety disorders, and for early detection of depression. This program can even help calculate children's protein needs and detect iron deficiency anemia in kids.

This was my first Java programming project and it served as my final assignment for semester 2. I worked on it with a colleague [Faiz Nurullah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faiznurullah/) who's awesome at developing projects. I learned a lot from him, from authentication systems, adding accounts, to login and registration. This experience was truly invaluable!
